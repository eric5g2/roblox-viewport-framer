# Disclaimer 
This is a project I made for fun, using : GetboundingBox is faster :) 

# roblox-viewport-framer
A simple plug and play module for framing objects in a viewport frame

# How to use: 
The module can be used independetly

Use getCamera(object, offset) to provice the object as a model or folder (please make sure that here are baseparts in the object)
The offset atribute is optional and allows for greater per model zoom levels, if not given it is gone use default values i found best

this is just a project i worked on when i was bored :) please use it for anything you want
